What is shell scripting ?
	Shell scripting is a text file with a list of commands that instruct an operating system to perform certain tasks or to perform the repetitive tasks.


How shell scripting used in devops and cloud ?
	Shell scripting in DevOps and Cloud refers to writing scripts using a command-line shell (like Bash, Sh in Linux, or PowerShell in Windows) to automate repetitive tasks, manage infrastructure, and streamline deployment processes.


Shell Scripting usage in DevOps & Cloud
 

	- Automated Server Setup
	  Installing packages, updating systems, creating users, setting permissions.
	
	- CI/CD Pipeline Tasks
	  Building code, running tests, packaging applications (often used in Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
	
	- Container Operations
	  Automating Docker image builds, container cleanup, Kubernetes CLIs (kubectl automation).
	
	- Log Management
	  Searching, filtering, archiving, and analyzing logs using grep, awk, sed.
	
	- Cron Jobs
	  Scheduling automated tasks (backups, cleanup, status checks).
	  
	  
	==============================================================	
	
	Shell script components :
	
	Usually a shell is nothing but an interface between the USER and OPERATING SYSTEM. (Zsh,sh,powershell,Bash -----shells)
	
							#!/bin/bash                               ------>Script first line
							
							# Statements or commands to be executed
							echo "This is a shell script running!"
	
	
			1)	#! 								---> A shebang is the first line of a script that tells the operating system which interpreter should run the script.
			2)	chmod +x script.sh				---> Give enough permission to execute script
			3)	./script.sh (or) sh script.sh 	--->Execute script
	
	
	for python scripts	
			script name : script.py
			
						  #!/usr/bin/python3   ---> The first line (shebang) tells Linux to use Python 3 interpreter
						  print("This is a Python script!")

			Execution	: python3 script.py		
			
	for node js scripts 
			script name : app.js
			
						  #!/usr/bin/node		---> Shebang tells Linux to use Node interpreter
						  console.log("This is a Node.js script!");
						  
			Execution	: node app.js

Why shell script needed in devops - Let's do a hand's-on task about to install docker on linux machine on Manual mode and Script mode 


1) Manual Mode — Running each command one by one takes time and some times leads to human errors

	> Install DNF Plugins Core
	
				command:	sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
		
		What it does and Why it’s needed:
		Installs the dnf-plugins-core package, which provides extra DNF utilities and plugins.
		One of the plugins we need is config-manager, which allows us to add and manage repositories. Without this, we couldn’t add the Docker repository.
		
		
	> Pre-installation / Setup prerequisite.
		
		Step 2: Add Docker Repository
				command:	sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
		
		
		What it does and Why it’s needed:
		Adds the official Docker repository to your system. This is where DNF will look for Docker packages.
		CentOS/RHEL default repositories do not contain the latest Docker packages, so we need Docker’s official repository to install the most up-to-date version.
		
	> Repository configuration.
		
		Step 3: Enable Docker Stable Repository
		sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled docker-ce-stable
		
		
		What it does and Why it’s needed:
		Ensures that the docker-ce-stable repository is enabled.
		Docker’s repo contains multiple channels (stable, test, nightly). Enabling the stable channel ensures we install a stable, production-ready version of Docker.
		
	> Repository configuration (enabling correct channel).
		
		Step 4: Install Docker
		sudo dnf install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
		
		
		What it does:
		Installs:
		
		docker-ce 				→ Docker Engine (core Docker daemon).
		docker-ce-cli 			→ Docker Command Line Interface.
		containerd.io 			→ Container runtime that Docker uses under the hood.
		docker-buildx-plugin 	→ Advanced build tool for multi-architecture images.
		docker-compose-plugin 	→ Docker Compose functionality for defining multi-container apps.
		
		What it does and Why it’s needed:
		This is the main installation step—without this, Docker won’t exist on your system. Installing all these ensures you have a fully functional Docker environment.
		
	> Installation.
		
		Step 5: Start Docker Service
		sudo systemctl start docker
		
		
		What it does and Why it’s needed:
		Starts the Docker daemon immediately.
		Docker must be running before you can use it. Without starting the service, Docker commands won’t work.
		
	> Service initialization.
		
		Step 6: Enable Docker on Boot
		sudo systemctl enable docker
		
		
		What it does and Why it’s needed:
		Configures the system to automatically start Docker on system boot.
		So that Docker is always available after a reboot without manually starting it.
		
	> Service configuration / automation.
		
		Step 7: Restart Docker
		sudo systemctl restart docker
		
		
		What it does and Why it’s needed:
		Restarts the Docker daemon.
		Ensures that any configuration changes or newly installed plugins take effect. It’s a common step to refresh the service after installation.
		
		
		
	NOTE:	If you install Docker manually on one machine, it doesn’t take much time. But imagine needing to install the same software (like Docker) on 10+ machines.
			As the number of servers increases, the manual process scales linearly 
			More machines = More time + More human errors.
			
		
2) Script Mode — Automated installation using a shell script
		
		Step 1: nano install_docker.sh			----> Create a script file
		
		Step 2: write down the below scripts in  on install_docker.sh file

				#!/bin/bash
				
				echo "---- Installing Docker on Linux ----"
				
				# Step 1
				sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
				
				# Step 2
				sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
				
				# Step 3
				sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled docker-ce-stable
				
				# Step 4
				sudo dnf install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
				
				# Step 5 & 6
				sudo systemctl enable --now docker
				
				# Step 7
				sudo systemctl restart docker
				
				echo "---- Docker Installation Complete ----"
				docker --version
	NOTE: 	A shell script lets you write commands once and run them anywhere, so installations become Faster Automated, Consistent, Repeatable, Scalable for hundreds/thousands of machines.
