What Are Environment Variables?
	Environment variables are key–value pairs stored in the shell environment. They help the operating system and applications understand configuration details such as user information
system paths, executable locations, and runtime configuration.	

Use cases
	- Pass configuration data to programs
	- Control shell behavior
	- Store sensitive or changeable settings
	- Avoid hard-coding values in scripts
	
How Environment Variables Are Used in DevOps ?

Environment variables are extremely important in DevOps because they allow flexible, secure, Cloud deployments, automated configuration across:

	CI/CD pipelines									 :	Used to pass secrets, build parameters, and deployment settings.
	Docker containers								 :  	Defining environment variables in Dockerfile:
	Kubernetes clusters								 :	Environment variables for pods:
	Configuration management (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) 				 :	Using environment variables for playbooks
	Secrets and API keys							 	 :	API key, Database passwords, Cloud credentials


Examples:	
	echo $HOME
	$HOME is an environment variable that stores your home directory path, e.g. /home/ubuntu.
	
	echo $PATH
	This variable contains directories the shell searches when running commands.
	
	creating your own:
	MYNAME="Kind_of_variable_or_name_or_Password_or_secret_or_Hardcoded_variable_anything"
	echo $MYNAME
	
	Set Temporary Environment Variables : These variables last only for the current shell/session. When you close the terminal, MYVAR disappears.
	export MYVAR="hello"
	
	To make them Permanent Environment Variables
	
	For bash:
	~/.bashrc (most common)
	~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile (login shells)
	
			Step 1: nano ~/.bashrc                    ---->Edit the shell config file
			Step 2: export MYVAR="hello-world"        ---->Add this to the file
			Step 3: source ~/.bashrc                  ---->Save and reload

			Now MYVAR will persist across sessions.
	For zsh:
	~/.zshrc
