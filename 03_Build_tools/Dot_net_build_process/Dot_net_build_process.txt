As a DevOps engineer, you don’t need to know every C# detail, but you must know the build commands, artifact formats (.dll/.exe), and publish structure to automate deployment reliably



Build = Convert source code into deployable artifacts

		For .NET :
				Source 			→ .cs, .csproj
				Build output 	→ .dll, .exe
				Deployable		→ published folder / Docker image
		
		Core concepts - Fundamental components before going to build dotnet applications
				.NET SDK		Provides compiler, runtime, and build tools.
				.csproj file	Project file containing dependencies, build rules, and target framework.
				dotnet CLI		Command-line interface used in automation/pipelines.
				Restore			Downloads all dependencies (NuGet packages).
				Build			Compiles source code into binaries (.dll/.exe).
				Publish			Prepares deployable files (for production or container deployment).
		
1)	Basic .NET build flow
	# 1. Restore dependencies
		 dotnet restore
									dotnet restore → Ensures all NuGet packages are available.
				

	# 2. Build the project
		 dotnet build
									dotnet build → Compiles .cs files into .dll or .exe in /bin/Debug or /bin/Release.

	# 3. Publish deployable artifacts
		 dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
						
									dotnet publish → Prepares files for deployment (/publish folder).
									
	
2)	Build Artifacts Location

	Stage		Output Location					File Type
	=====  		===============					============
	Build		/bin/Debug/net7.0/				.dll / .exe
	Publish		/bin/Release/net7.0/publish/	Deployable folder (ready for servers or Docker)
	
	
	
	
3)In CI/CD pipelines, these steps translate to:

	Restore dependencies 	→ dotnet restore
	Build application 		→ dotnet build
	Run tests 				→ dotnet test
	Publish artifacts 		→ dotnet publish
	Package & deploy 		→ Copy publish folder to server, or build a Docker image.
