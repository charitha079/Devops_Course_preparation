Build Tools

	1)Build :
		
		The process of transforming source code into a runnable application. This typically includes compiling, running automated tests, and packaging the code with necessary dependencies into an artifact.
		To generate a usable version of the application (or) we can say that to create a usable, functional version of the application.	
		



		Common Build Outputs (Artifacts):
			Desktop Apps		: .exe (Windows), .dmg (macOS), .app
			Java Applications	: .jar (Java ARchive), .war (Web Application Archive)
			Mobile Apps			: .apk (Android), .ipa (iOS)
			Web Apps			: Bundled/Minified assets like .zip or .tar.gz packages
			Containers			: Docker images
			
		Examples:
			Maven/Gradle compile Java code into a .jar file
			PyInstaller packages Python scripts into a .exe



	2)Deploy : 

		The process of taking the built application and delivering it to a live environment where users can access it.
		To make the application available on target environments such as servers, cloud infrastructure, user devices, or an app store.

		Examples:
			Deploying a .jar file to a server and starting the service
			Uploading an .apk to the Google Play Store for distribution




	3)How BUILD and DEPLOY Work Together
		Build are a critical part of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) pipeline because they ensure that code can be reliably built, tested, and packaged before deployment.
		Build tools can be integrated with deployment tools to automate the entire path from code → build → deploy (commonly known as CI/CD).
		A build may occur without deployment (e.g., internal testing).
		Deployments often go first to staging or test environments before reaching production.
		
		
		Build 	→ produces the artifact
		Deploy 	→ delivers and runs it for users
		Often automated together in CI/CD pipelines
		
		
		
Summary  :	
			1)Build tools automate the creation, testing, packaging, and deployment preparation of software, making them a core part of DevOps pipelines.
			2)Build	Create an executable version	.jar, .exe, .apk, etc.
			3)Deploy	Make that executable available to users	Live/usable app
			4)You can also build without deploying (internal testing), and you can deploy to test environments before production.
