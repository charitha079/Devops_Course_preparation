Maven Lifecycle – Complete Explanation
what is maven ?

Maven is a Java build automation and dependency management tool used to:
	Build Java applications
	Manage libraries (dependencies)
	Standardize project structure
	Automate the complete build process

	In short:	Maven = Build + Dependencies + Automation for Java


What is Maven Lifecycle?

A Maven lifecycle is a fixed sequence of steps (phases) that Maven follows to build, test, package, and distribute a Java application.

	-	You do not run all steps manually.
	- 	You run one command, and Maven automatically executes all required steps in order.
	
	( or )
	
	Maven lifecycle is a predefined sequence of build phases that automates compiling, testing, packaging, installing, and deploying applications. Running one phase automatically executes all previous phases.



Why Maven Lifecycle is Needed

Without lifecycle:
	Manual compilation
	Manual testing
	Inconsistent builds
	“Works on my machine” problem

With lifecycle:
	Standard build process
	Automation
	Repeatable builds
	CI/CD friendly

Maven Has 3 Lifecycles

Lifecycle	Purpose
Default	Build & deploy application
Clean	Remove old build files
Site	Generate documentation
1️⃣ Default Lifecycle (MOST IMPORTANT)

This is the main lifecycle used in real projects & CI/CD.

Default Lifecycle Phases (Order Matters)

	1:validate
	2:compile
	3:test
	4:package
	5:verify
	6:install
	7:deploy

Explanation 

1. 	validate
	Checks project structure
	Ensures pom.xml is correct
	Example: mvn validate

2. 	compile
	Compiles source code (.java → .class)
	Code stored in target/classes
	Command: mvn compile

3. 	test
	Runs unit tests
	Uses testing frameworks (JUnit/TestNG)
	Does NOT package the app
	Command: mvn test

4. 	package
	Packages compiled code
	Creates:
	.jar (Spring Boot / Java app)
	.war (Web app)

	Output:	target/myapp-1.0.jar
	Command:mvn package

5. 	verify
	Runs additional checks
	Integration tests
	Code quality checks
	Used mostly in advanced pipelines

6. 	install
	Copies artifact to local Maven repository
	Path:~/.m2/repository
	Command:	mvn install
	Use case:
	Other local projects can use this dependency

7. 	deploy
	Uploads artifact to remote repository
	Used in CI/CD pipelines
	Repositories:
		Nexus
		Artifactory
		GitHub Packages
		AWS CodeArtifact

Command:	mvn deploy
