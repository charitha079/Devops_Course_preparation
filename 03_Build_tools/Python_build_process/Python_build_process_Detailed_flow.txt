Step 1:️Install Python

	Make sure Python is installed on your system (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.).
	Command :
		sudo yum install python3 python3-pip -y   # Amazon Linux
		sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y   # Ubuntu

Step 2:Create Project Structure
		Set up a standard Python project directory:
		
		python-app/
		├── app.py
		├── requirements.txt
		├── setup.py        # optional
		├── pyproject.toml  # optional modern config
		├── tests/
		└── venv/           # local only

Step️ 3:	Create Isolated Environment (venv)
		Keeps dependencies separate from system Python.
		python3 -m venv venv
		source venv/bin/activate  # activate venv

Step 4:	Install Dependencies

		Use requirements.txt or pyproject.toml:
		pip install -r requirements.txt
		For modern projects using Poetry or PDM:
		poetry install

Step 5:️	Validate (Optional Tests)

		Run unit tests to ensure code works before packaging:
		pytest tests/
		This step is optional but highly recommended for CI/CD.

Step 6:	Run Application

		Make sure your app runs correctly:
		python app.py

Step 7:Package Artifact

		The final artifact can be one of:
		Virtual environment (just zip your venv/ with your code)
		Wheel (.whl)
		python setup.py bdist_wheel
		Zip file (for serverless deployments)
		Docker image (most common in DevOps pipelines)

Conclusion:
Your “Manual build process” diagram is correct. For Python, the artifact is usually the code + dependencies, packaged either as a wheel, zip, or Docker image for deployment.
