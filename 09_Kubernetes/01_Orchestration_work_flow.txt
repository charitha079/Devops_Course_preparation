What is Kubernetes Orchestration?
	Kubernetes orchestration is how Kubernetes automatically deploys, schedules, scales, heals, and manages containerized applications across a cluster of machines (nodes).
	
	workernode :
		kubelet: Pod lifecycle manager
		
			- Talks to the API Server
			- Creates, starts, stops Pods on the node
			- Ensures containers match the desired state
			- Performs health checks (liveness/readiness probes)
			- Reports node & pod status back to control plane	
			
		
		kube-proxy: Networking & traffic manager (per node)
			- Implements Services (ClusterIP / NodePort / LoadBalancer)
			- Handles network traffic routing to Pods
			- Uses iptables / IPVS rules
			- Load-balances traffic across healthy Pods
			
		Container Runtime : with run time applications will run inside the pods
			- Container execution engine - containerd,CRI-O
			- Responsible for running containers
			- Pulls container images from registries
			- Creates and starts containers inside Pods
			- Stops and deletes containers when required
			- Works with kubelet via CRI (Container Runtime Interface)
		Container Runtime — Container execution engine

		CNI (Container Network Interface) — Pod networking provider
		Calico
		Flannel
		Cilium
		Assigns IP addresses to Pods
		Enables Pod-to-Pod communication
		Enables Pod-to-Service communication
		Handles cross-node networking
		Enforces Network Policies (if supported)
