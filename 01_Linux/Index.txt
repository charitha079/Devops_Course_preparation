1.Concept: Linux Filesystem

	Navigating Files & Directories
	Linux uses a hierarchical directory structure, starting from root (/).
	Everything starts at / (root directory).

	Key commands :
	1.1 pwd — Print Working Directory - Shows your current directory location.

	Usage:
	cmd:pwd
	Example output:/home/user/projects

	1.2 ls — List Directory Contents
	Lists files and directories.

	Common Usages:
	ls          # list names only
	ls -l       # list with details (permissions, size, date)
	ls -a       # show hidden files (files starting with .)
	ls -lh      # human-readable sizes
	ls -ltr     # sort by time, newest at bottom

	1.3 cd — Change Directory
	
	Navigate to a different directory.
	
	Usage examples:
	
	cd /var/log
	cd ~        # go to home
	cd ..       # go up one directory
	cd ../..    # go up two levels
	cd -        # go to previous directory
	
	1.4 tree (optional)
	
	Shows directory tree.
	
	tree /etc
	
2.Managing Files (cp, mv, rm):		These commands manipulate files and directories.
	
	2.1 touch — Create Empty File
	touch file.txt
	
	2.2 mkdir — Create Directory
	mkdir myfolder
	mkdir -p devops/scripts/logs    # create nested folders
	
	2.3 cp — Copy Files
	Basic copy:
	cp file1.txt file2.txt
	
	Copy folder recursively:
	cp -r folder1 folder2
	
	Copy with verbose output:
	cp -v file.txt /backup/
	
	2.4 mv — Move or Rename
	Move:
	mv file.txt /home/user/docs/
	
	Rename:
	mv oldname.txt newname.txt
	
	2.5 rm — Remove (Delete)
	Delete file:
	rm file.txt
	
	Delete folder:
	rm -r foldername
	
	Force delete (dangerous):
	rm -rf /
	NEVER RUN THIS — it wipes your system.
	
3.Viewing Files (cat, less, head, tail)
	3.1 cat — Display File Content
	cat file.txt
	
	With line numbers:
	cat -n file.txt
	
	3.2 less — View Large Files (Best for logs)
	less /var/log/syslog
	
	
	Navigation inside less:
	
	Up/Down arrows	
	q = quit	
	/keyword = search	
	n = next match
	
	3.3 head — First Lines of File
	head file.txt
	head -20 file.txt  # first 20 lines
	
	3.4 tail — Last Lines of File
	tail file.txt
	tail -f /var/log/syslog   # live log monitoring
	
4.Permissions (chmod, chown):		Linux permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file.
	
	4.1 Permission Types
	
	Permission	Symbol	Meaning
	read		 r		view file content
	write		 w		modify/delete
	execute		 x		run as a program
	
	4.2 Permission Groups
	
	Linux assigns permissions for:
	
	Owner
	Group
	Others
	
	Run:
	ls -l
	
	You’ll see:
	-rwxr-xr--  1 user group  123 Jan 1 script.sh
	
	
	Breakdown:
	
	rwx → owner
	r-x → group
	r-- → others
	
	4.3 chmod — Change Permissions
	Symbolic:
	chmod u+x script.sh    # add execute to owner
	chmod g-w myfile       # remove write from group
	chmod a+r file         # give read to everyone
	
	Numeric mode:
	Number	Meaning
	7		rwx			->READ,WRITE,EXECUTE
	6		rw-         ->READ,WRITE
	5		r-x			->READ,EXECUTE
	4		r--			->READ
	
	So:
	chmod 755 script.sh
	
	
	Means:
	
	Owner: rwx    7 ---READ,WRITE,EXECUTE
	Group: r-x    5 ---READ,EXECUTE
	Others: r-x   5 ---READ,EXECUTE
	
	4.4 chown — Change Owner
	chown user file
	chown user:group file
	
	
	Example:
	
	chown root:root /var/www/html
	
5.System Info Commands:		These commands give system-level information needed for DevOps & troubleshooting.
	
	5.1 uname — System Info
	uname -a
	Shows kernel version, architecture, OS type.
	
	5.2 uptime — System Uptime
	uptime
	
	
	Also shows system load averages.
	
	5.3 df — Disk Usage
	df -h
	Shows mounted partitions and free space.
	
	5.4 du — Directory/File Size
	du -sh /var/log
	
	5.5 top — Live Process Monitor
	top
	
	Alternative (better):
	htop
	
	5.6 free — Memory Usage
	free -h
	
	5.7 whoami — Current User
	whoami
	
	5.8 id — User ID and Groups
	id
	
	5.9 hostnamectl — Host Information
	hostnamectl

6. Text Processing & Shell Scripting Essentials:		These commands help extract, filter, modify, and search text — essential for DevOps.

	6.1 grep — Search Text in Files
	Search patterns in files (works with regex).
	
	Basic search:
	grep "error" logfile.txt
		
	Case-insensitive:
	grep -i "warning" logfile.txt
		
	Recursive search in directory:
	grep -r "keyword" /var/log/
    
	Show line numbers:
	grep -n "root" /etc/passwd
	
	6.2 awk — Smart Text Processing
	
	Reads files line-by-line and processes fields (columns).
	Print first column:
	awk '{print $1}' file.txt
	
	Print specific columns:
	awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
	
	Filter rows:
	awk '$3 > 50' data.txt   # print rows where 3rd column value > 50
		
	Field separator:
	awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd   # print usernames
	
	6.3 sed — Stream Editor (Modify Text)
	Search + replace values inside file.
	Replace first occurrence in each line:
	sed 's/old/new/' file.txt
	Replace all occurrences:
	sed 's/error/OK/g' file.txt
		
	Delete lines:
	sed '/delete_me/d' file.txt
	
	6.4 find — Search Files & Directories
	Locate files by name, type, size, etc.
	
	Find by name:
	find /home -name "*.log"
		
	Find by size:
	find /var -size +100M
		
	Delete matching files (use carefully):
	find . -name "*.tmp" -delete
	
	6.5 sort — Sort Text
	
	Sort alphabetically:
	sort names.txt
		
	Sort numerically:
	sort -n numbers.txt
		
	Reverse sort:
	sort -r data.txt
	
	6.6 uniq — Remove Duplicate Lines
	
	Show unique lines:
	uniq file.txt
	
	
	Count occurrences:
	uniq -c file.txt | sort -n
	
	6.7 wc — Count Words, Lines, Characters
	
	Count lines:
	wc -l file.txt
	
	
	Count words:
	wc -w file.txt
	
	
	Show all counts:
	wc file.txt
	
	6.8 cut — Extract Columns by Character/Delimiter
	Cut first 10 characters:
	cut -c 1-10 file.txt
	
	
	Cut specific field (columns) using delimiter:
	cut -d ":" -f 1 /etc/passwd   # show usernames
	
	6.9 xargs — Execute Commands from Output
	
	Example: delete files listed from a command:
	find . -name "*.bak" | xargs rm -f
