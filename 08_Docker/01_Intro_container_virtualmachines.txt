why virtualization and containers evolved ?
	
	
	
	Resource wastage
		CPU used 10–15%, rest idle

	High cost
		More servers → more power, cooling, space

	Slow provisioning
		Weeks to buy & install servers

	No isolation
		One app crash → entire server down

	Hard to scale
		Scaling = buying new hardware

	Environment mismatch
		“Works on my machine” issue
		
		
	Virtualization evolved  to checkmate those problems	
	
	
1)	Virtualization ?
	
	Virtualization is the technology that allows you to run multiple isolated systems (VMs) on a single physical machine.
	Core Component: Hypervisor
					A Hypervisor is the software that creates and manages virtual machines.
	
		- One physical server → many Virtual Machines (VMs)
		- Each VM has its own OS, CPU, RAM, Disk
		- Multiple apps on one server 
		- Better resource usage
		- Cost reduction
		- Faster provisioning
	
	
	How DevOps Uses Virtualization

		Spin up build servers dynamically
		Create test environments quickly
		Blue-Green & Canary deployments
		Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
		
		
		
		problems with virtualization ?
		
		- Heavyweight		: Each VM has its own OS
		- Slow boot time	: Minutes to start
		- High resource usage
		- Image sprawl	:Managing many VM images
		- Not ideal for microservices
		- Slower CI/CD pipelines
		
	Containers evolved to checkmate virtualization problems	
		
		
2)	What are containers ?

	In DevOps, a container is a lightweight, portable unit that packages:

		- Application code
		- Runtime (Java, Python, Node, etc.)
		- Libraries & dependencies
		- System tools & configs
	
	Containers allow applications to run in isolated environments with all required dependencies, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production.
	
		Containers Problems 	: 
			- Security isolation weaker than VMs
			- Complex networking
			- No built-in orchestration
		kubernetes evolved to 	:
			- Manage thousands of containers
			- Auto-healing, scaling, load balancing
	

	
		Containers vs virtualmachines
		- Containers virtualize the application layer, while VMs virtualize the entire operating system.
	
		
	
3)	Devops workflow :
	
		1️ Physical Servers (Bare Metal)
				↓
		2️ Virtual Machines (VMware, KVM)
				↓
		3️ Cloud Computing (AWS EC2)
				↓
		4️ Containers (Docker)
				↓
		5️ Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)
				↓
		6️ DevOps / GitOps / Platform Engineering
		
		
		
4)	Short summary : 	
		- Virtualization solved hardware underutilization and enabled cloud computing.
		- Containers solved VM inefficiencies and enabled microservices.
		- Kubernetes solved container management at scale.
