# Evolution of Virtualization and Containers
	
	This document explains **why virtualization and containers evolved**, their differences, and their role in modern DevOps workflows.
	
	---
	
## Why Virtualization and Containers Evolved
	
	Traditional IT faced several problems:
	
	1. **Resource Wastage**  
	- CPU used 10–15%, rest remained idle.
	
	2. **High Cost**  
	- More servers → higher power, cooling, and space costs.
	
	3. **Slow Provisioning**  
	- Weeks to buy and install servers.
	
	4. **No Isolation**  
	- One app crash could bring down the entire server.
	
	5. **Hard to Scale**  
	- Scaling required buying new hardware.
	
	6. **Environment Mismatch**  
	- “Works on my machine” issues.
	
	**Virtualization evolved to address these problems.**

## 1️) Virtualization
	
	**Definition:**  
	Virtualization is the technology that allows running multiple isolated systems (**VMs**) on a single physical machine.
	
	**Core Component:**  
	- **Hypervisor:** Software that creates and manages virtual machines.
	
	**Benefits:**
	
	- One physical server → many Virtual Machines (VMs)  
	- Each VM has its own OS, CPU, RAM, and Disk  
	- Multiple apps can run on a single server  
	- Better resource usage → cost reduction  
	- Faster provisioning of servers
	
	**How DevOps Uses Virtualization:**
	
	- Spin up build servers dynamically  
	- Create test environments quickly  
	- Blue-Green & Canary deployments  
	- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
	
	**Problems with Virtualization:**
	
	- Heavyweight: Each VM has its own OS  
	- Slow boot time: Minutes to start  
	- High resource usage  
	- Image sprawl: Managing many VM images  
	- Not ideal for microservices  
	- Slower CI/CD pipelines

## 2️)Containers
	
	**Why Containers Evolved:**  
	Containers were introduced to solve virtualization inefficiencies and better support modern DevOps workflows.
	
	**Definition:**  
	A container is a lightweight, portable unit that packages:
	
	- Application code  
	- Runtime (Java, Python, Node, etc.)  
	- Libraries & dependencies  
	- System tools & configurations
	
	**Benefits:**
	
	- Run applications in isolated environments  
	- Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production  
	- Lightweight and fast to start  
	- Ideal for microservices architecture
	
	**Problems with Containers:**
	
	- Security isolation weaker than VMs  
	- Complex networking  
	- No built-in orchestration
	
	**Solution:** Kubernetes
	
	- Manages thousands of containers  
	- Auto-healing, scaling, load balancing
	
	**Containers vs Virtual Machines:**
	
	| Feature        | Virtual Machines (VMs)          | Containers                  |
	|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
	| Virtualize     | Entire OS                      | Application layer           |
	| Isolation      | Strong                         | Lightweight                 |
	| Startup Time   | Minutes                        | Seconds                     |
	| Resource Usage | High                           | Low                         |
	| Ideal for      | Monolithic apps                | Microservices               |

## 3️)DevOps Workflow Evolution
	
	```
	Physical Servers (Bare Metal)
			↓
	Virtual Machines (VMware, KVM)
			↓
	Cloud Computing (AWS EC2)
			↓
	Containers (Docker)
			↓
	Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)
			↓
	DevOps / GitOps / Platform Engineering
	```

## 4️)Short Summary
	
	- **Virtualization** solved hardware underutilization and enabled cloud computing.  
	- **Containers** solved VM inefficiencies and enabled microservices.  
	- **Kubernetes** solved container management at scale.

## 5️)Notes on Environment and Dependency Mismatch
	
	**Dependency Mismatch:**  
	Occurs when required libraries or runtimes differ:
	
	1. App needs Python 3.9, server has Python 3.7  
	2. App needs Java 11, prod has Java 8  
	3. App needs libssl 1.1, OS has libssl 1.0  
	4. Node app needs a package version that isn’t installed
	
	**Environment Mismatch:**  
	Broader than dependency mismatch; includes OS, configurations, and system differences:
	
	- Kernel differences  
	- Dependency mismatch  
	- Environment variables  
	- File paths & permissions  
	- System configurations  
	
	*Dependency mismatch is one cause of environment mismatch.*
