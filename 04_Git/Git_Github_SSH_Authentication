SSH :
A secure connection method using keys, not passwords.

(or)

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol that lets you securely connect to another computer over a network.

    -Log into remote servers
    -Run commands on a remote machine
    -Transfer files securely


What are SSH Keys?
        SSH keys are a way to log in to a server without typing a password — and more securely.

They come as a pair:
    1. Private Key
            Stored on your computer
            Must be kept secret
            Like your personal signature

    2. Public Key
            You upload it to the server or GitHub
            Safe to share
            Like a lock that only your private key can open

How keys work ?
    The server checks if it has your public key(you need to upload the publicket initially).
    If it matches → you're authenticated.

    
Why are SSH Keys Used on Servers ?

    Servers use SSH keys to let admins log in securely.

        Benefits:
        Passwords can be guessed; private keys cannot
        Faster authentication
        Can automate tasks (scripts, deployments)
        Harder to hack because the private key stays local

Why are SSH Keys Used in Git & GitHub ?
        GitHub needs to confirm your identity.
        Instead of entering your GitHub password every time, you authenticate with SSH keys.


GitHub workflow:

Step 1 :You generate SSH keys on your computer

        cmd:ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

            Private key → ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
            Public key → ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Step 2 :You upload public key → GitHub
            Github login -> Settings ->SSH and GPG Keys ->New SSH Key -> add Public key
Step 3 :Your private key stays with you
Step 4 :Test the SSH connection
        cmd   :ssh -T git@github.com
        output:Hi XXXXX! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
            
Step 5 :GitHub checks your key when you push or pull
Step 6 :This makes Git operations secure and convenient.
