Problems before CI/CD ? How CI/CD tools helped ?

	
	
	1️.Manual Builds
		Developers built code manually on their own machines
		Different environments → “Works on my machine” problem - dependency conflicts issues
		No standard build process
	
		Result: 
			Inconsistent builds
			frequent failures
		
	2️.Late Detection of Bugs
		Code was integrated after days or weeks
		Bugs were found very late (during QA or production)
	
		Result:
			Costly bug fixes
			Delayed releases
	
	3️.No Automated Testing
		Tests were run manually
		Developers often skipped tests due to time pressure
	
		Result:
			Broken features
			Low code quality
	
	4️.Painful Code Integration (Merge Hell)
		Developers worked on branches for a long time
		Merging code caused conflicts and failures
	
		Result:
			Integration nightmares
			Unstable main branch
	
	5️.Manual Deployments
		Deployment steps written in documents or emails
		Human errors during deployment
	
		Result:
			Downtime
			Rollback issues
	
	6️.No Visibility
		No single place to know:
		Build status
		Test results
		Who broke the build
	
		Result:
			Blame game
			Slow troubleshooting
	
	
What is cicd  ?

	- CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment).
	- It is a DevOps practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code whenever developers make changes.
	
	What is jenkis ?
	
	- Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used to implement CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) in DevOps.
	- It is widely used to build, test, and deploy applications automatically whenever code changes happen.
	


What Jenkins Solved ?

Jenkins introduced Continuous Integration (CI).

1 Automated Builds
	Automatically builds code on every commit
	Same environment for everyone
	Solved: Inconsistent builds

2️ Early Bug Detection
	Runs build + tests immediately after code push
	Bugs found within minutes
	Solved: Late bug discovery

3 Automated Testing
	Unit, integration, regression tests run automatically
	Solved: Skipped or manual testing

4️ Continuous Integration
	Developers merge code frequently
	Jenkins integrates and validates changes continuously
	Solved: Merge hell

5️ Automated Pipelines
	Build → Test → Package → Deploy
	One-click or fully automated releases
	Solved: Manual deployments

6️ Centralized Visibility
	Dashboards show:
	Build status
	Logs
	Test reports
	
	Solved: Lack of transparency

7️ Integration with DevOps Tools

	Works with:
	GitHub / GitLab
	Docker
	Kubernetes
	SonarQube
	AWS / Azure
	
	Solved: Tool fragmentation



	
	
CD (Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment)

	While CI focuses on building and testing code, CD focuses on releasing that code to environments automatically.
	In Continuous Delivery, code is automatically deployed to lower environments such as Dev, QA, and Staging, but production deployment requires manual approval.
	Lower environments :
					1)Dev
					2)Qa
					3)Staging
					
	Higher environments : 
					4)Prod  ----> Manual intervention needed through approvals

	In Continuous Deployment, the entire process is fully automated, and successful builds are deployed to production without any manual intervention.

Flow:

	Git → CI → Deploy to Dev → QA → (Manual Approve) → Prod

Typical stages in pipeline :
	Commit → Build → Test → Deploy to Dev → Deploy to QA → Deploy to Staging → Manual Approval → Deploy to Prod


Continuous delivery vs continuous deployment ?

	Continuous Delivery ensures code is always ready for production with manual approval, 
	whereas Continuous Deployment automatically deploys every successful build to production without human intervention.
